# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
In this analysis project we are to analize the number of retiring employees per title and identify employees who are eligible to be includeded in the mentorship program. With the aquired and exported data we summarize and display accurate data for Bobby’s manager and help prepare for the “silver tsunami” that is occuring with the many employees reaching retirement age.
